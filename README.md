hello all, almost every week new tools come out with new 
developments related to icloud and apple devices, how crazy 
computers are in the human life can give you what you need . 
we still did not get a full icloud bypass but we fill something 
will como up very soon. many tools are helping to go step forward and some time we going 
back to the beginning but for now we still are our run to remove icloud.
Today we going to share a new tool will help you a lot making a custom firmware this 
tool will make all to you. you just need the Keys and IV keys from the Firmware Keys â€“ The iPhone Wiki 
(https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Firmware_Keys)
not every models will got the keys but we still waiting for updates.

Notes
Certain files share the same key and IV per application processor (per build) provided the devices have the same pixel resolution:

Update Ramdisk
Restore Ramdisk
AppleLogo
BatteryCharging0
BatteryCharging1
BatteryFull
BatteryLow0
BatteryLow1
GlyphCharging
GlyphPlugin
Kernelcache
NeedService
RecoveryMode
SEP-Firmware
WTF
The table on the right lists the application processors and their corresponding devices. This list is also accessible from the main page.
You can use img3decrypt or xpwntool to decrypt these files as described in Decrypting Firmwares. Once done, mount or extract using the tool of your choice.
The firmware version number for the Apple TV builds are the ones that the Apple TV reports (also known as the "marketing version").
All dates are relative to UTC.
GID AES is used by iBoot to decrypt firmware images. When iBoot loads the kernelcache, GID AES is disabled. This means in order to get firmware keys, you must gain code execution in a setting where GID AES is still enabled. In most cases, this means exploiting iBoot itself, before the kernelcache is loaded.
Firmware Versions

This is a full and comprehensive list of all firmwares Apple Inc. has made available to the public in some way, be it the dev center or iTunes. This list also contains a few firmwares for which there never was an IPSW (as far as can be told) such as 4.2.5 for the CDMA iPhone 4 (iPhone3,3). These few builds came preinstalled on the device, but are not available for download.
